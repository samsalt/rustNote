# Notes on Separating Rust Modules into Files

This note summarizes the process and rules for splitting modules into separate files in a Rust project to improve organization and navigation as the codebase grows.

### 1\. Extracting a Top-Level Module

To move a module defined in your crate root (`src/lib.rs` or `src/main.rs`) into its own file:

1.  **Declare the module in the crate root file.** Replace the module's code block with a simple declaration ending in a semicolon.

      * **Example `src/lib.rs`:**
        ```rust
        // This tells Rust to look for the module's content elsewhere.
        mod front_of_house;

        pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

        pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
            hosting::add_to_waitlist();
        }
        ```

2.  **Create a new file for the module.** Create a Rust file with the same name as the module in the `src` directory.

      * **Example `src/front_of_house.rs`:**
        ```rust
        // Contents of the front_of_house module go here.
        pub mod hosting {
            pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        }
        ```

### 2\. Extracting a Submodule (Nested Module)

To move a submodule into its own file:

1.  **Declare the submodule in its parent module's file.**

      * **Example `src/front_of_house.rs`:**
        ```rust
        // Declare the child module `hosting`.
        pub mod hosting;
        ```

2.  **Create a directory named after the parent module.**

3.  **Create the submodule's file inside the new directory.**

      * **Example `src/front_of_house/hosting.rs`:**
        ```rust
        // Contents of the hosting submodule go here.
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        ```

### 3\. File Path Conventions

The Rust compiler uses a clear set of rules to find module files.

#### Idiomatic (Current) Style

  * Module `foo` in crate root -\> `src/foo.rs`
  * Submodule `bar` of `foo` -\> `src/foo/bar.rs`

#### Older (Still Supported) Style

  * Module `foo` in crate root -\> `src/foo/mod.rs`
  * Submodule `bar` of `foo` -\> `src/foo/bar/mod.rs`

> **Note:** Using both styles for the same module will result in a compiler error. The main drawback of the `mod.rs` style is having many files with the same name, which can be confusing in an editor.

### Key Concepts to Remember

  * **`mod` is a Declaration:** The `mod` keyword tells the compiler to include the module's code from its corresponding file. It is a declaration, not an "include" operation found in other languages. You only need to declare a module once in its parent.
  * **`use` Doesn't Affect Compilation:** The `use` keyword brings paths into scope to shorten them but has no impact on which files are compiled as part of the crate.
